            MRS. DELANE. To-day it is he is coming, and it's likely he was in that
            train. There was a card about him to Sergeant Carden this morning.

            MR. QUIRKE. A young chap from Carrow they were saying he was.

            MRS. DELANE. So he is, one Hyacinth Halvey; and indeed if all that is
            said of him is true, or if a quarter of it is true, he will be a credit
            to this town.

            MR. QUIRKE. Is that so?

            MRS. DELANE. Testimonials he has by the score. To Father Gregan they
            were sent. Registered they were coming and going. Would you believe me
            telling you that they weighed up to three pounds?

            MR. QUIRKE. There must be great bulk in them indeed.

            MRS. DELANE. It is no wonder he to get the job. He must have a great
            character, so many persons to write for him as what there did.
